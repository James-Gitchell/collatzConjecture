<p>
	The Collatz conjecture (also known as 3n+1 conjecture) is a conjecture that applying the following algorithm to any number we will always eventually reach one:
	<br />
	<code>
		if(number is even) number = number / 2<br />
		if(number is odd) number = 3*number + 1
	</code>
</p>
<p>
	Make a function <code>hotpo</code> that takes a positive <code>n</code> as input and returns the number of times you need to perform this algorithm to get <code>n = 1</code>.
</p>

<input type="number" id="input" placeholder="0" />
<input type="submit" id="submit" value="Submit" />
<br />
<div id="output"></div>

<p>
	<code>
	hotpo(1) returns 0
(1 is already 1)

hotpo(5) returns 5
5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

hotpo(6) returns 8
6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

hotpo(23) returns 15
23 -> 70 -> 35 -> 106 -> 53 -> 160 -> 80 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
	</code>
